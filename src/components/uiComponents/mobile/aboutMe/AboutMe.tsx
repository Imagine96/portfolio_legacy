        My name is Rub√©n, front end developer and my passion is bringing ideas
        and designs to the internet in the form of handcrafted websites and
        webapps because I see in it more than an essential business tool for
        sales and marketing, a form of expression not just for the business
        behind it, but also for the designer who dreams it and the developer who
        conceives it.
        <br /> <br />
        I specialize in building user interfaces and client-side
        functionalities and manage html and different css and js tools and
        frameworks, which ensures greater scalability and customization even
        after the final product is delivered
